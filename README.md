# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm [Your Name]!

### üöÄ About Me

I'm a passionate **Computer Science & Engineering** student and aspiring **AI/ML Engineer & Data Scientist**. I love building intelligent systems using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.  
I enjoy working on projects that blend data analysis, predictive modeling, and software development. With a strong foundation in programming (Python, C++, SQL), I constantly strive to learn new technologies and apply them in real-world applications.  

Currently, I am focusing on creating innovative healthcare solutions, like my **Medical Diagnosis Assistant** project, which uses advanced ML and DL approaches for symptom-based disease prediction.

Apart from coding, I enjoy sketching and exploring new tech trends. I‚Äôm always open to collaboration and eager to learn from the community.
